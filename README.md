# Number-plate-detection
6th semester CV Project

## Number plate recognition:
License plate recognition, also known as license plate detection or recognition through image processing techniques, is a promising field of study in smart city and Internet of Things (IoT) development. With a significant rise in the number of vehicles, there is a growing need for automated systems to manage vehicle data for various applications.


## Abstract: 
The security personnel at our campus have to manually verify the details of each vehicle
entering and exiting the premises. This process is tedious, time-consuming, and requires
them to work in harsh outdoor conditions, such as scorching sunlight. All the vehicles entries
are made in a offline documents, which are prone to physical damage. The objective of this
project is to develop an automated number plate detection system that can efficiently
identify and record the license plate numbers of vehicles passing through the campus gates.
This system aims to reduce the workload on security guards, streamline the vehicle
entry/exit process as well as remove the use of offline documents and manual entries. Such
a system can also help reduce manual errors that may arise due to bad handwriting,
erroneous reading or hearing of license plate numbers.
The main benefits over traditional system are:-
- Improved Efficiency: The system automates the license plate reading process,
significantly reducing processing time and eliminating queues at entry points.
- Enhanced Accuracy: By eliminating human error in data entry, the detection system
ensures accurate identification of vehicles and promotes robust security.
- Reduced Reliance on Manpower: The system frees up security personnel from manual
verification tasks, allowing them to focus on more strategic security measures.
- Improved Working Conditions: Security guards are no longer required to stand
outdoors in harsh weather, leading to improved working conditions and potentially
higher alertness.
